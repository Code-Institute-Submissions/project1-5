# The Monkees- Project I

Here I have designed a frontend-only website for a rock-pop music band of the 60s called "The Monkees". 
This website is composed of a single scrolling page with 4 sections and a second page for getting in contact with the band.

The scrolling page has 4 the following sections:
a. The home: Big image of the group band.
b. About: Here you can get to know about their history and their members.
c. videos: here you can watch a performance of the band.
c. Music: you can choose between 4 songs to listen.

The contact page contents a form where the user can ask the band to perform for an event or party.

Both pages have a navbar that allows the user to navegate between themselves and to the different 
sections of the scrolling page. They also share the footer, where you can find direct acces to the 
contact page and the social media links ( Facebook, Twitter and YouTube).


 
## UX
 
This website has been designed to offer the fans, new and old, a nice experience where they can get 
to know more about their favorite band. The visitors of this website will be able to learn more about 
the history of the Monkees, who were their members, watch their videos and listen to clips of their back catalog.
 
-As a user, I would like a website with the music and videos of my favorite band, 
then it should be a section for each of these.
-As a user, I would like to know as much as possible about my favorite band, then there should
be a section giving information about them.
-As a user, I would like to contract the band for a party, then it should be a section where I can
contact with the band.
-As a user, I would like to check their facebook, twitter or youtube. The website should allow me
to visit also those sites.


The wireframe of this project was made with hard paper and pen.

## Technologies Used

This project was made with HTML5 and CSS3. Besides those, the following tools were used:

Language:English.
Libraries: 
.Bootstrap v4.1.3 Most of the applied style, the Scripts (JavaScript,  jQuery and Popper.js)
to get functionality in the Bootstrap's components. http://getbootstrap.com/
.fontawesome v5.3.1 The icons for message box, facebook, twitter and YouTube and CopyRight.
https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
GoogleFonts. From here I got the font type of the whole website (permanent market).https://fonts.google.com/
.Onw CSS style sheet. To make my own styles and overwrite some of the Bootstrap style library.


## Testing
 The whole code was validated through  the Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/).
 The code was continuously monitored through the "Inspect" function of the Google Chrome Browser. 
 Making sure that the website was completely responsive.
 The project looks as expected in different browsers (GoogleChrome InternetExplorer).
 
 1 navbar:the navbar in both pages allows you to nav to the exact place you want in the website 
 between them.
 2 Each audio and video was first tested separately to check how well were they in the site.
 3 Each external link was clicked to check that it redirect you to the place it is supposed to.
 4 Form: if you try to submit it empty or with a wrong email address, a message telling you about
 the relevant error appears.
 
 
 The whole website has a right side margin which origen is unkwon to me. 
 It has been difficult to center the navbar.
 I have had problems with the justify-content-center utilitie of Bootstrap.
